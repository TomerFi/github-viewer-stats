# Architecture

## File Organization
- `src/index.js` — Main module exports
- `src/api.js` — GraphQL client factory (singleton)
- `src/cli.js` — CLI entrypoint
- `src/contribs.js` — User contribution stats
- `src/repo.js` — Repository stats
- `src/org.js` — Organization stats

## Dependency Policy
- Keep runtime dependencies minimal (only `@octokit/graphql`)
- Dev dependencies for linting only
